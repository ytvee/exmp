# ThemeProvider

The `ThemeProvider` is used to change the theme between Dark and Light modes. It provides a context for managing the current theme and allows components to access the theme properties.

## Usage

Wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider` to enable theme switching:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from './path/to/ThemeProvider';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>{/* Your application components */}</ThemeProvider>
);
```

## Theme Switching

You can toggle between themes using the `toggleTheme` function provided by the context:

```jsx
const { toggleTheme } = useTheme();
```

## Storybook Example

See the [ThemeProvider stories](./ThemeProvider.stories.tsx) for examples of how to use the `ThemeProvider` in your components.
