# Responsive Design

Responsive design adapts the flow and layout of information to respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform, and orientation. Adjusting the flow of information and visual elements may require an optimized user experience to fit content within specific display parameters. It may also require limiting the design layout to include only the necessary modules, depending on the device’s parameters and resolution.

## Breakpoints
Breakpoints are values at which a web page’s content resizes and reflows to match the screen size on a given device. Designing for various breakpoints allows designers and developers to optimize the display of information for users on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

We use a common set of breakpoints at which the information shown on the screen can be adjusted. For full documentation of the token names and values for these breakpoints, refer to the **Breakpoints** section in **Design Tokens**.

## Breakpoint Sizes

These tokens roughly correspond to the following sizes:

- **S – Small (mobile): 576 – 768 px**  
  – any smartphone from compact to “plus”.
- **M – Medium (tablet): 768 – 992 px**  
  – tablet in portrait orientation.
- **L – Large: 992 – 1200 px**  
  – tablet in landscape orientation or small laptop.
- **XL – X‑Large: 1200 – 1400 px**  
  – standard and large desktop monitors.

When designing across breakpoints, remember that the information flow should remain roughly the same. For example, on desktop you might have a row of three text blocks, but on mobile they need to stack vertically while preserving their order (left to right).

Keep in mind how components change when designing for different screen sizes and how this impacts the page’s spacing and margins.

## Designing with Breakpoints

To make sure a design remains mobile‑friendly, UX and UI designers should start with mobile layouts first. The mobile‑first approach prioritizes smaller screens, allowing designers to guarantee scalability and accessibility while maintaining a consistent information flow on every device.
